This repository contains the Myntra Data Analysis project, where I performed data cleaning, importation into PostgreSQL, and executed several queries to extract key insights from the dataset. The dataset includes product-related details from Myntra, and the project demonstrates how to handle and analyze product data using PostgreSQL.

Key Activities in This Project:
Data Cleaning in MS Excel: Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates and trimming extra spaces.

Data Import into PostgreSQL: Utilized the COPY function to import the cleaned CSV file into a PostgreSQL database.

SQL Queries: Performed aggregation and filtering using PostgreSQL functions such as VIEW, COUNT, DISTINCT, and more to analyze the data.

Insights: The analysis focused on extracting valuable insights like popular product brands, price distribution by gender, and the number of images associated with each product.

This project highlights my proficiency in data cleaning, working with databases, and executing SQL queries to extract actionable business insights. The repository includes the cleaned dataset, SQL queries, and visualizations (screenshots) of the key analysis outputs.
